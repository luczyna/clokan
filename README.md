# Clokan

A simple watch. Set the color to your mood by clicking/tapping around.

## To change the background color

You can click anywhere on the background to change the color. Color is determined with `hsl`, or hue, saturation, and lightness. Depending on the area you click/tap, you will alter a value of the `hsl` color definition.

- the top third of the screen will change hue
- the middle third will change saturation
- the bottom third will change lightness
- how far from the left of the screen will change the value of either hue, saturation, or lightness.

## To change the time color

Click/tap the time to activate it. You'll see a white border around it. Then click anywhere in the background to start changing it's colors, much like you would the background color.
